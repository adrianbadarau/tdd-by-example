# Kotlin version of Test Driven Development By Example

This is my refactored repository, the result of me follwing the course and implementing the material in Kotlin

All source code examples in the repository are for my [Online Course - Testing Spring Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_REPO)

Examples provided have been inspired by Kent Beck's examples in his book [Test-Driven Development By Example](https://amzn.to/2DTP58p)

In this repository, I look at using Beck's classic TDD Money Example - updated to Java 11 and JUnit 5. 

## Setup
### Requirements
* Should use Kotlin 1.3 or higher. Previous versions of Java or Kotlin are un-tested.
